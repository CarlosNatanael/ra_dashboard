    <h2>What does each Status mean?</h2>
    
    <p>These are the statuses a set can have during the review process:</p>
    
    <h3>Pending</h3>
    <p>
        This is the default status. The set has been added by an admin and is in the main queue, waiting for a Code Reviewer (CR) to pick it up.
    </p>

    <h3>In_Discussion</h3>
    <p>
        A CR has "claimed" your set and is actively testing it (peer review). Triggers, save state protection, and descriptions are being checked. Keep an eye on Discord or the game page for feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>In_Review</h3>
    <p>
        The set has passed the initial peer review and is now with an official Code Reviewer (CR) for final approval. This is the last step before promotion.
    </p>

    <h3>Approved</h3>
    <p>
        Congratulations! Your achievement has been approved and moved to the <a href="/history">History</a> page. The next step is to check your open tickets and always request a review when asking to promote or demote an achievement.
